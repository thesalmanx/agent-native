/**
 * agent-friction-report.mjs
 *
 * Measures how often the user has to correct an agent about the same thing,
 * by reading local Claude Code and Codex transcripts and counting matches for
 * a table of known friction patterns, bucketed by week.
 *
 * Why this exists: on 2026-07-31 an audit claimed unrequested branch creation
 * was a live problem needing a tool-level block. Measuring it showed the
 * opposite — 10 occurrences in early July, then zero in the twelve days after
 * `.agents/skills/new-branch/SKILL.md` gained its activation guard. Guidance
 * had already closed it, and a block would only have fired on the correct
 * post-merge workflow.
 *
 * That is the whole point: a claim about agent behaviour is checkable, and the
 * check is cheap. Before adding any mechanism that constrains agents, run this
 * and confirm the pattern is still live. After changing a skill, run it again
 * a couple of weeks later and confirm the pattern actually declined. A rule
 * nobody measures is a rule nobody can tell is working.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/agent-friction-report.mjs                # last 8 weeks
 *   node scripts/agent-friction-report.mjs --weeks 4
 *   node scripts/agent-friction-report.mjs --pattern cheap-model
 *   node scripts/agent-friction-report.mjs --self-test
 *
 * Reads only local transcript files; makes no network calls and writes nothing.

/**
 * Each entry is a correction the user should not have to repeat. `fixedBy`
