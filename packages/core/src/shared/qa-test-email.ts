/**
 * Identities that automated checks create, so tracking can drop their events
 * before they reach a provider.
 *
 * Every pattern here must be impossible for a real signup to match. The
 * reserved domains and TLDs come from RFC 2606 / RFC 6761 and are permanently
 * undeliverable, so matching them cannot suppress a real user. Do not add a
 * pattern that merely looks synthetic — `test@`, `demo@` and `qa@` are real
 * addresses people sign up with.
 *
 * Widened after a fleet audit found 17 synthetic signups reaching production
 * analytics: the original pattern only matched plus-addressed
 * `+qa-test-bot-…@`, so `an-e2e-probe-…@e2e.agent-native.test`,
 * `e2e-…@example.com` and bare `qa-test-bot-…@` all slipped through.
