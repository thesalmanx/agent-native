/**
 * App identity.
 *
 * Three fields, not one, because the eight environment keys that spell "which
 * app is this" were never all the same question:
 *
 * - `id` is this deployment's own identity — data programs, onboarding, the
 *   CLI, and agent model defaults scope by it.
 * - `workspaceId` is the identity a workspace deploy assigns. `vault_grants`
 *   rows are written with it, so credential scoping must prefer it over `id`
 *   or an app would look up grants under a name nobody granted.
 * - `name` is the user-facing display name ("Acme"), used in transactional
 *   emails and page titles. It is not an identifier, and only leaks into
 *   identity resolution as a last-resort fallback in readers that had nothing
 *   better.
 *
 * Collapsing these into one field is the tempting simplification and it is
 * wrong: it would silently repoint credential grant lookups.
 *
 * None of them has a default. `credentialProvider` denies access when no app
 * identity is configured, and a default of `"app"` would turn that denial into
 * a lookup scoped to an app literally named `app`. Readers that want a
 * placeholder apply it themselves, where it is visible.
