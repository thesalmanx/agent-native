/**
 * Server-side Yjs document manager with LRU caching and SQL persistence.
 *
 * Performance notes:
 * - `getDoc()` loads the state blob from the DB on cache miss, then keeps the
 *   Y.Doc in memory. A cache hit still costs one version-column SELECT: this
 *   process is one of many serverless instances, so a doc cached here can be
 *   arbitrarily far behind a peer instance's writes, and a read that skips
 *   the check returns old text that looks current. The blob is re-read only
 *   when that version actually moved.
 * - Mutations no longer call `applyStoredState()` unconditionally on every
 *   write. The defensive re-read from the DB happens only inside
 *   `persistMergedState` (needed for the CAS version read), not as a
 *   separate SELECT before applying the new update. This removes the
 *   redundant double-read that the previous implementation performed on
 *   every write even on a hot cache.
 * - Compaction: when the stored blob is >4x the freshly encoded state, the
 *   GC'd encoding is stored instead (removes accumulated Yjs tombstones,
 *   preventing unbounded blob growth without any background jobs).
