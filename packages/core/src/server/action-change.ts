 * Whether THIS invocation should announce a change.
 *
 * `readOnly` describes an action name, but a tool that discriminates on an
 * argument reads on some calls and writes on others — `manage-agent-engine`
 * with `action: "list"` is a status poll, with `action: "set"` a write. Such
 * actions already publish the per-call answer as a Plan-mode `effect`
 * predicate, so read it here instead of treating every call as a write: a poll
 * that bumps the `"action"` change version makes every query keyed on it
 * refetch forever.
 *
 * `readOnly` stays authoritative otherwise. Widening the flag to cover mixed
 * tools would also open them to read-only A2A peers and to the agent's
 * read-result cache, where it would be false.
