/**
 * Self-registration with the Builder Realtime Gateway.
 *
 * Apps deployed by the Builder hosting pipeline are handed a channel id and an
 * HMAC secret as reserved env vars, because the pipeline already knows their
 * database — it provisioned it. An app deployed anywhere else has neither, and
 * the gateway has no way to reach its database at all, so hosted realtime was
 * effectively pipeline-only.
 *
 * This closes that gap from the app's side: when hosted transport is on and no
 * channel was injected, the app tells the gateway its own Postgres URL and
 * public origin, authenticating with the deployment's `BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY` —
 * the same credential it already holds for the LLM gateway. It gets back a
 * channel id and secret and mints subscribe tokens exactly as a pipeline app
 * does.
 *
 * Registration runs on demand rather than from a CLI so it self-heals: the
 * database URL, the app origin and the secret all follow the deployment. A
 * connection string pasted once by hand goes stale on rotation and takes the
 * tail down silently.
 *
 * Everything here fails soft. No credential, a non-Postgres database, the org's
 * flag off, the gateway unreachable — all resolve to `null`, the token mint
 * 404s, and the client stays on the app's own `/_agent-native/poll`.
