/**
 * Credential provider abstraction.
 *
 * Every feature that needs an external credential (Anthropic API key,
 * Google OAuth tokens, OpenAI key, Slack bot token, etc.) should go through
 * one of the resolve*() helpers here instead of reading `process.env`
 * directly. That way the same feature can work in three modes:
 *
 *   1. User set their own key in .env              → use it directly
 *   2. User connected Builder via OAuth            → authorize managed Builder requests
 *   3. Neither                                      → throw FeatureNotConfigured
 *
 * Templates catch FeatureNotConfigured and show a "Connect Builder (1 click) /
 * set up your own key (guide)" card.
 *
 * Today these helpers are used by the Builder-hosted LLM gateway, and the
 * shape is meant to grow to cover future managed credential integrations
 * (e.g. additional Builder-hosted services) without rewrites.

 * `resolveBuilderCredential`'s org fallback — no per-user re-connect
 * needed. A plain member or a user with no active org writes at
 * `scope: "user"` (the safe default that doesn't trample the org's shared
 * connection).
 *
 * Stale-credential cleanup: before writing the new values we (1) clear ALL
 * five BUILDER_* keys at the target scope, so optional fields the new
 * connection doesn't carry (e.g. user picked a Builder space that returns
 * no orgName) don't leave the previous connection's metadata behind, and
 * (2) when writing at org scope, also clear the writer's own user-scope
 * BUILDER_* rows so a stale personal override from an earlier connect
 * doesn't shadow the new org write on resolution (user scope wins org
 * scope by design — see `resolveScopedBuilderCredential`). The org-scope
 * row is intentionally left alone when writing at user scope: that row is
 * shared with the rest of the org and a single user's personal override
 * shouldn't blow it away. (Victoria's "I signed in again with my Builder
 * space and it still says no credits" report on 2026-05-11 was exactly
 * this stale-shadow case.)
