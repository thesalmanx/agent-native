// deferral (server/production-agent.ts) leaves a successor row `running` with
// no live worker until a sweep redispatches it. The budget is a derived
// chain, each bound comfortably inside the next:
//   UNCLAIMED_BACKGROUND_RUN_GRACE_MS            (25s)

// < UNCLAIMED_BACKGROUND_RUN_REDISPATCH_BOUND_MS (300s, run-store.ts)

// this timeout at all while `/runs/active` reports `awaitingRedispatch:
// true` — a server-authoritative "known deferred, recovery in progress"
// signal, not a guess — so this timeout is a backstop for a genuinely lost
// run, not the primary mechanism racing the sweep. Do NOT raise this value to
// paper over a slow sweep; fix the sweep timing (run-store.ts /
