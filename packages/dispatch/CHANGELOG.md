## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- d7d12c0: Add owner-scoped app adoption metrics to the Dispatch admin.

- 32b49a8: Keep Dispatch page scrolling inside the viewport and replace the global header with a sticky agent-chat control.
- Release all public npm packages with a patch version bump.
- 318819b: Give the Dispatch workspace embed handshake a cold-boot connect budget so opening an app whose server is still starting no longer fails as unreachable. `McpClientManager` now accepts a `connectTimeoutMs` option, and the embed session mint spends up to 90s per attempt within a 95s total budget instead of the 5s interactive default, matching the dev gateway's own readiness wait.

## 0.31.16

### Patch Changes

- 36c79f9: Use the authenticated workspace app registry for hosted Dispatch app lists so inaccessible apps do not get an Open app action.

## 0.31.15

### Patch Changes

- c595519: Automations page now writes the selected automation into a `?automationId=` URL param instead of untracked local state, so a selected row can be linked, reloaded, and reached with browser Back on both `/automations` and `/admin/automations`.
- c595519: Fix a workspace app opened from Dispatch chat-first mode on a narrow viewport mounting its own full-screen agent chat rail on top of the already full-screen side surface panel.
- c595519: Fix the chat-first side surface panel's close toggle being stacked beneath the panel it controls on viewports at or below 767px, which made the panel undismissable.
- d74aff9: Keep Dispatch's Feedback, Search, and Collapse controls flush with the bottom of the left sidebar.
- af1b3bb: Derive the chat model selection localStorage key through one exported helper, `chatModelSelectionStorageKey`. `useChatModels` takes the raw key while `MultiTabAssistantChat` takes only the namespace suffix, so a hero composer that passed the same string to both wrote to a different key than the chat beside it and never saw its model picks.

## 0.31.13

### Patch Changes

- f2f60b9: Move the environment badge to the bottom-left, show a truthful dev badge during configured local development, raise Dispatch controls above it, and give default notifications enough clearance to avoid overlap.

## 0.31.12

### Patch Changes

## 0.31.5

### Patch Changes

- d30d701: Move workspace-app sharing into each app's settings menu so cards keep their primary open action focused.

## 0.31.4

### Patch Changes

- 10de7b9: Remove unused imports and unreachable declarations. Dispatch drops unused
  imports from its layout, transactional email pages, and MCP gateway;
  creative-context drops unused type imports and an unread `headingStyle`;
  recap-cli drops the `node:os` import and two unread locals; skills drops the
  unreferenced `maybeUpdateInstructions` helper; toolkit drops unused imports and
  an unread `REALTIME_VOICE_REQUEST_SOURCE`. No runtime behavior changes.
  `eslint/no-unused-vars` is now an oxlint error instead of a warning, so CI
  blocks new ones.
- Updated dependencies [10de7b9]

- Updated dependencies [a2f21dc]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.16.6

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.29.5

## 0.29.1

### Patch Changes

- 96ecc13: Use compact app search and pin labels that stay on one line.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 772f59a: Point the chat beside an open workspace app at that app's own agent. Dispatch now proxies `/_agent-native/workspace-app-chat/<appId>/**` to the app's `/_agent-native/agent-chat`, authenticated with the app's own embed session, so the rail has the app's tools, AGENTS.md, skills, app-scoped resources, and dev-mode surface instead of Dispatch's. When the proxy cannot be established the rail shows a retryable error rather than silently answering from Dispatch's agent, and workspace-level chat with no app open is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 772f59a: Allow workspace members to update mounted app names and descriptions from Dispatch.
- 772f59a: Report the embedded workspace app to the Dispatch agent as structured context. `/apps/<id>` now resolves to a `workspace-app` navigation view that keeps the app id and in-app path instead of collapsing to the apps list, and `view-screen` emits an `embeddedApp` block for both that route and chat-first mode, where the route stays on `/chat` and the open app is named only by `chat-first-pane` state. An app that is open but cannot be identified reports `status: "unknown"` rather than a default or an omitted field.
- 772f59a: Share the canonical localized authentication copy with native sign-in surfaces
  and allow authenticated packaged callers to mint workspace embed sessions.

## 0.28.1

### Patch Changes

- 2107a36: Retry cross-app embed session authentication with the shared A2A secret when a workspace target rejects an unsynchronized organization secret.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- d3702a5: Point the chat beside an open workspace app at that app's own agent. Dispatch now proxies `/_agent-native/workspace-app-chat/<appId>/**` to the app's `/_agent-native/agent-chat`, authenticated with the app's own embed session, so the rail has the app's tools, AGENTS.md, skills, app-scoped resources, and dev-mode surface instead of Dispatch's. When the proxy cannot be established the rail shows a retryable error rather than silently answering from Dispatch's agent, and workspace-level chat with no app open is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.16.4

## 0.27.16

### Patch Changes

- 3850b75: Retry workspace embed-session minting with the shared A2A secret when a target rejects org-secret authentication, with redacted mint diagnostics. Keep SSO fanout limited to canonical and explicitly registered own-origin apps; path-mounted workspace apps remain same-origin with Dispatch and keep their existing ambient session behavior, so this narrows fanout targets but is not origin isolation.
- 3850b75: Resolve workspace embed pages from an app's canonical home URL instead of a deep A2A link, and allow extensions rendered in the hosted workspace to load in their parent frame.

### Patch Changes

- 907dfa3: Hide redundant Agent-Native SSO controls inside embedded workspace app views while preserving the app's normal login and signup controls.
- 907dfa3: Resolve hosted workspace app sign-in from the authenticated live registry so custom mounted apps can receive Dispatch embed sessions without a copied app list. Keep the registry action scoped to its verified A2A caller and refresh the desktop canary identity state before automatic sign-in.
- 907dfa3: Preserve organization Google-only policies during shared sign-in by marking only Dispatch identities with a verified Google account link, while keeping existing local accounts and sessions additive.

- 81fb79e: Keep Dispatch's collapsed chat-first sidebar actions visible and icon-only, matching the Electron rail.
- 81fb79e: Keep selected chat-first apps visible and open granted external apps from Dispatch.
- 81fb79e: Make shared-auth rollout failures fail closed while allowing an explicitly allowlisted operator to manage feature flags across deployments without a local organization. Clear stale Dispatch fallback errors after a successful direct load, and keep hosted chat restore controls local-only.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 89f194f: Add a default-off Dispatch workspace sign-in rollout for iframe app panes. The
  flagged path mints short-lived, app-scoped embed sessions for exact first-party
  origins, explicitly registered custom workspace apps, and same-origin mounted
  workspace apps without changing the existing MCP access policy.
- 89f194f: Add folder-backed agent packs with safe Claude/Cowork-style import, agent-owned
  references and skills, and a shared Factory Agents surface for managing simple
  agents alongside mounted agentic apps.
- 89f194f: Add a simple Agents workspace for creating reusable profiles, importing Claude-style or generic agent definitions, and connecting existing HTTP/A2A agents.

### Patch Changes

- 89f194f: Keep visited workspace app frames mounted while switching apps so returning restores live state instantly.
- 89f194f: Provision cross-app SSO state and authorization-code tables during release migrations so production serverless requests never perform schema DDL.

## 0.23.5

### Patch Changes

- 62a17be: Add the authenticated, nonce-only completion route used by packaged Desktop clients during cross-app identity federation.

## 0.19.1

### Patch Changes

- db62d66: Consolidate every MCP setting on `createAgentChatPlugin` under one `mcp: {}` option, and add `mcp.catalog: "app"`.

  `mcp` accepts `enabled`, `catalog`, `connectorCatalog`, `externalAgents`, `builtinCrossAppTools`, `title`, `description`, `websiteUrl`, and `icons`. The top-level `disableMcp`, `mcpServerInfo`, `connectorCatalog`, and `externalAgents` stay accepted for one minor and are deprecated; the nested value wins, and setting both forms to disagreeing values throws at plugin init rather than booting an app with an MCP surface nobody chose (same contract as `resolveFrameworkTools`). `disableMcp: true` and `mcp.enabled: false` are normalized as inverses, so a correctly migrated app is not read as a conflict.

  Two behavior fixes come with it:
  - `builtinCrossAppTools` had no route through the plugin at all — it was reachable only by calling `mountMCP` directly. That is why `frameworkTools: "minimal"` and `workspaceApps: false` could never remove the cross-app builtins (`list_apps`, `open_app`, `ask_app`, `ask_app_status`, `create_embed_session`, `create_workspace_app`, `list_templates`) from an app using the normal plugin entry point: the MCP layer merges them downstream of the `frameworkTools` filter. `mcp.builtinCrossAppTools: false` is now the switch.
  - A2A read the connector policy straight off the raw plugin options, so `mcp.connectorCatalog` would have narrowed the MCP surface while A2A kept serving the old one. `filterDirectA2AActions` / `buildAuthenticatedAgentA2ASkills` now take the resolved shape, so the two external surfaces cannot diverge.

  `mcp.catalog: "app"` serves external callers exactly the app's own tool registry, flat — the same actions the in-app agent holds, with no cross-app builtins, no `ask-agent`, no `tool-search`, and no compact/connector trimming. `externalAgents.denyActions` and the OAuth scope filter still apply, since both are explicit removals rather than catalog tiering, and the dev-open surface split is unchanged (an unauthenticated loopback probe still gets `actions`, not `productionActions`). Weigh the token cost before setting it: an app registering ~100 actions puts every schema in the caller's context on `tools/list`, which is what the compact default exists to avoid.

  Also folds the per-tier `tools/call` gate into one rule — the advertised set is the callable surface on every tier except the explicit `--full-catalog` opt-in — so adding a tier can no longer default to "everything callable" by omission.

  `tool-search` is fixed on both ends over MCP. It is dropped entirely from every flat catalog (`mcp.catalog: "app"` and the `--full-catalog` opt-in), where every tool is already listed beside it and it could only describe its own neighbours. On the trimmed catalogs, where it does earn its place, it is now scoped to the advertised set: previously it closed over the app's whole registry while `tools/call` accepted only the advertised subset, so it answered with names that came straight back as "Unknown tool". `attachToolSearch`, `searchToolRegistry`, `createToolSearchEntry`, `TOOL_SEARCH_ACTION_NAME`, `resolveFrameworkTools`, `filterFrameworkToolGroups`, and `frameworkGroupEnabled` are now exported from `@agent-native/core/server`, so a standalone `mountMCP` plugin can compose the same surface the agent-chat plugin does instead of hand-rolling a copy that drifts.
