 * `status: "candidate"`. None of that reaches the kit's content —
 * `shouldIncludeAssetInLibraryResults` keeps unsaved candidates out of every
 * library read — so it is a write a read-only collaborator can safely make.
 *
 * Approving is everything that changes what the kit *is*: promoting a
 * candidate to `saved`, uploads, imports, folders, collections, style brief,
 * canonical logo, templates, deletes. That still requires `editor`.
 *
 * Route new generation paths through `assertCanDraft` and new save/organize
 * paths through `assertCanApprove` instead of picking a role literal per
 * action, so the boundary stays readable in one place.
