Monitor PR #$ARGUMENTS in the current repo. Fix CI failures and human or bot review feedback until everything is green and no new feedback arrives for 30 minutes.

A worktree is a valid PR checkout. When monitoring from one, keep Git and
GitHub commands in that worktree's cwd and current branch; do not copy changes
to the shared checkout or require that an agent publish from the root checkout.

## Branch-wide Snapshot Rule

During `/babysit-pr`, the PR remains the unit of review and the shared checkout
is the branch snapshot. At the first tick, record dirty paths and unpushed
commits; publish the requested initial work only after verifying that every
candidate belongs to this PR's requested fix. If unrelated or incomplete
concurrent work is present, preserve it for its owner and wait. On later ticks,
inspect the tree before every push. Run `corepack pnpm ship:push` only when the
current branch contains an actionable change required by failing CI, PR
feedback, a real merge conflict, or an explicit user request. A clean tree,
`origin/main` drift, queued checks, or a timer tick is not a reason to commit
or push. Never publish unrelated concurrent work, and never revert, stash, or
overwrite it.

When an actionable fix is actively changing, publish one coherent snapshot
once it is ready, then push it to the existing PR so CI and review agents can
work in parallel. The final clean-tree and merge-soak gates still apply before
merging, except when the user explicitly invokes `/ship-now`.

**If no PR number is given**, auto-detect it: get the current branch (`git branch --show-current`), find the open PR for it (`gh pr list --head <branch> --state open --json number --limit 1`). If no open PR exists, check recent merged/closed PRs. Only ask the user if no PR can be found.

## Setup

1. Run a self-re-arming tick loop. Do ONE tick (see "Each tick"), then immediately schedule the next one with `ScheduleWakeup` before yielding — pass this same `/babysit-pr <number> …` invocation back as the wake-up prompt so the next firing repeats the tick. The loop ends only at a stop condition (below); until then there is **always** a scheduled next tick.
2. Track when the last actionable item (new human/bot feedback, CI fix, merge-conflict resolution, or a local-change commit/push) occurred.
3. After 30 minutes of no new actionable items with GitHub Actions CI green, cancel the loop (stop scheduling wake-ups) and report "All clear".

### Loop discipline — read this, it is the part people get wrong

- **Cadence: tick every 60–120 seconds while the PR is active** (CI running, recent pushes, feedback within the last few minutes, or a fast-moving branch where concurrent agents keep adding files). Only relax toward ~3 minutes once the PR is genuinely quiet (all checks green, no new commits or comments for a while). A churning branch needs the tight end of that range — new local files and new CI results show up constantly and must be picked up promptly.
- **NEVER stall waiting.** Do not end a turn "waiting" for CI, a review, or a background command without a scheduled wake-up. If you kick off a background command (e.g. `pnpm run prep`), you may rely on its completion notification **but always also schedule a fallback `ScheduleWakeup`** — notifications can silently fail to fire, and an unguarded wait becomes an indefinite stall. The loop must keep ticking regardless.
- **Do not let slow or flaky local validation block the loop.** `pnpm run prep` / `vitest` can hang or take minutes, and on a branch with concurrent edits a full local run is contaminated by other agents' in-flight files anyway. If local validation is slow, hung, or unreliable, **push and let the CI you are already monitoring be the validation gate** — a red CI job is caught and fixed on the very next tick. Prefer pushing your work over holding it for a clean local run.
- **Every tick, expect new local files.** On an active shared branch, concurrent
  agents may edit the checkout continuously. Re-run Step 0 every single tick
  to detect actionable changes, but publish only the fixes allowed by the
  Branch-wide Snapshot Rule above.

## Each tick

**Step 0 — always do this first, before anything else:**

```bash
if ! git fetch origin --quiet; then
  echo "Cannot refresh origin refs; stop before checking unpublished commits." >&2
  exit 1
fi
git status --short
git diff --name-only
if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$(git branch --show-current)"; then
  git log --oneline --decorate "origin/$(git branch --show-current)"..HEAD -- . ':(exclude)learnings.md' ':(exclude)bridge/**' ':(exclude)data/**'
else
  git log --oneline --decorate HEAD --not --remotes=origin -- . ':(exclude)learnings.md' ':(exclude)bridge/**' ':(exclude)data/**'
fi
```

After the status check, run `corepack pnpm ship:push` only when the dirty or
unpushed work is the intentional fix for a concrete CI failure, PR feedback,
merge conflict, or explicit user request. If the tree is clean and already
pushed, do nothing. If it is clean with unpushed commits, push them directly
only when those commits are already an intentional actionable fix; never create
a new maintenance commit merely to make the branch look current.

Every tick starts here, no exceptions: on an active shared branch local files
can change within minutes, so re-check before every actionable push.

**Never `git stash` concurrent changes.** Stashes get orphaned, and a stash named `babysit-tickN-concurrent-work-*` left on the source branch while babysit-pr's PR ships without it is exactly how real work gets lost. If you see local changes you don't recognize, preserve them for their owner; do not hide them in a stash or commit them here.

**Step 1 — check for merge conflicts:**

1. Run `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json mergeable --jq '.mergeable'`.
2. If `CONFLICTING`: bring `main` in and resolve. First inspect the worktree
   and unpushed commits; do not run the merge until the publishable-path check
   `git status --short -- . ':(exclude)learnings.md' ':(exclude)bridge/**'
   ':(exclude)data/**'` and the branch-specific unpublished-commit check in
   Step 0 are empty. The unpublished-commit check is also scoped to
   publishable paths, so excluded-only commits do not block recovery. Preserve
   and report excluded paths; they do not block
   recovery unless the merge itself touches them.
   Before merging, compare the local checkout with the live PR head:

   ```bash
   pr_head=$(gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')
   if [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$pr_head" ]; then
     echo "Local HEAD is not the live PR head; stop and let the branch owner reconcile it." >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

   If either publishable-path check is non-empty, do not attempt an in-place
   isolation. Preserve the exact dirty paths and unpublished commits, leave the
   checkout untouched, and wait for the owning session to publish or move its
   work. A separate clean PR worktree may perform this recovery when one is
   already available. Never use `git stash`, reset, restore, or a temporary
   branch as a substitute for retaining concurrent work.

   Do not merge an obsolete local head.
   **Publish any intentional actionable fix first (Step 0)**, after verifying
   every dirty path and unpushed commit belongs to that fix; then prefer a
   **merge** over a rebase —
   `git fetch origin main && git merge --no-edit
   origin/main` — because this branch is shared with concurrent agents and a
   rebase would rewrite history and require a force-push that can clobber their
   unpushed commits. Resolve the conflicts (for `pnpm-lock.yaml`, take one side
   with `git checkout --theirs -- pnpm-lock.yaml` then regenerate with `pnpm
   install --lockfile-only` against the merged `package.json`), complete the
   merge commit, and push (a normal push, never `--force`). This resets the soak
   timer. If unrelated or incomplete concurrent work keeps the worktree dirty,
   preserve it and wait for its owner instead of stashing, restoring, or
   forcing the merge. Do not merge `origin/main` again while the PR is
   `MERGEABLE` or `UNKNOWN`, or while checks are merely pending; a conflict-free
   PR does not need another main merge. Only rebase if the user explicitly asks
   for a linear history.
3. If `MERGEABLE` or `UNKNOWN`: proceed. (`mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` with `mergeable: MERGEABLE` just means required checks are still pending/red — that is not a conflict; keep going.)

## Latest-feedback handoff

If the PR body or branch cites `/review-latest-feedback`, treat its start
cursor, grouped reports, evidence links, and disposition table as part of the
PR's review state. At the first tick, record that handoff. On every later tick
before the merge gate, re-read the handoff and check for new Slack replies,
GitHub feedback, and Sentry findings after its cursor using the configured
connectors. A new actionable report resets the soak timer and needs a fix or a
concise reply before merge. If a connector is unavailable, record it as
unavailable in the recap rather than treating it as no findings.

**Then proceed with PR checks:**

1. Check for review comments and review summaries from humans and bots — **EVERY tick, with no exceptions.**

   > ⚠️ **Review bots (Builder, Copilot, etc.) RE-REVIEW on every push and post a brand-new round of comments each time.** A PR commonly accumulates several rounds. You MUST re-check on every single tick — including "quiet" ticks where you're only waiting on CI — and you must keep checking right up until the moment you merge.
   >
   > **Never filter comments by a "since <timestamp>" window.** A forward-looking timestamp silently skips rounds that were posted *before* your last reply (e.g. a round that landed between the first review and when you replied), and "0 new since X" reads as "all addressed" when it is not. This exact mistake left two whole review rounds unanswered on PR #1097 (2026-06-08).

   Instead, determine coverage by **reply state**: list every top-level review comment that does **not** yet have a reply, across all pages and all rounds. Stream every comment with `--jq '.[]'` (concatenates cleanly across pages), then slurp:
   ```bash
   gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/comments --jq '.[]' \
     | jq -s '
       ([ .[] | .in_reply_to_id // empty ]) as $replied
       | .[]
       | select((.in_reply_to_id // null) == null)              # top-level comments only
       | select(.id as $id | ($replied | index($id)) | not)     # …with no reply yet
       | {id, user: .user.login, path, line: (.line // .original_line), snippet: (.body[0:200])}'
   ```
   (Bind the id with `.id as $id` first — `index(.id)` would evaluate `.id` against the `$replied` array, not the comment, and error out.) If that command prints anything, there is unaddressed feedback — fix or reply to each (see "Responding to feedback") before you consider the PR clean. Also re-read the latest review **summary** bodies each tick (bots restate their findings here):
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/reviews --jq '.[] | select(.body != null and .body != "") | {user: .user.login, state, submitted_at, body: .body[0:1000]}'
   ```
   Treat the count of unaddressed comments (not a timestamp) as the source of truth for "is there feedback to handle".

2. Check CI status:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks $ARGUMENTS
   ```

3. **If new human or bot feedback includes real bugs or requested changes**:
   - Read the relevant files
   - Fix the issues
   - Run `pnpm run prep` to verify locally
   - Run `corepack pnpm ship:push` to publish the complete fix snapshot
   - Reply inline to each addressed inline comment, or post a PR comment summarizing addressed items when the feedback was in a review body
   - Reset the 30-min timer

4. **If GitHub Actions CI is failing** (lint, test, typecheck, build):
   - Investigate the failure logs
   - Fix the root cause
   - Run `pnpm run prep` locally
   - Run `corepack pnpm ship:push` to publish the complete fix snapshot
   - Reset the 30-min timer

   **Special case: missing changeset.** If the failing job is `Require changeset for publishable package changes` (from `.github/workflows/changeset-check.yml`), do NOT treat it as a code bug. The job log includes a structured line `MISSING_CHANGESET_PACKAGES: pkg1,pkg2`. Parse that, then write a `.changeset/<short-slug>.md` directly — do NOT run the interactive `pnpm changeset add`. Use the PR title and diff to decide bump type (default to `patch` for bugfixes / docs / refactors; `minor` for additive features; `major` only when the PR description clearly signals breaking). Shape:
   ```md
   ---
   "@agent-native/<pkg-1>": patch
   "@agent-native/<pkg-2>": patch
   ---

   <one-line summary derived from the PR title>
   ```
   Slug example: `dispatch-route-shells.md` (kebab-case, descriptive, ~3 words). Commit with `chore: add changeset for <packages>`, push, reset the timer. The check will pass on the next CI run.

5. **If only external CI fails** (Cloudflare Workers, Netlify, etc.) and GitHub Actions passes:
   - Note the failure but don't block on it — these may need dashboard config changes
   - Do NOT reset the 30-min timer for external-only failures

6. **If everything green + no new feedback for 30 min**: cancel the loop, report done

## Responding to feedback

**Every human or bot comment must get a reply** — either a fix or an explanation of why you're skipping it.

- If you fix it: commit, push, AND reply inline confirming the fix. Fixing code marks the comment as "outdated" in GitHub's UI, but the user needs to see the reply to know you addressed it — don't rely on the outdated status alone.
- If you skip it: reply to the comment via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/comments/{id}/replies -f body="..."` explaining why (pre-existing, false positive, not practical, etc.)
- If the issue is real but you didn't introduce it: fix it anyway and reply. Real bugs should be fixed regardless of who wrote the code.
- If feedback appears in a review summary/body rather than an inline thread: fix the items you agree with, then post a top-level PR comment referencing the review and listing what was fixed; explicitly mention any items you skipped or disagreed with and why.
- **Never silently ignore a human or bot comment** — every single one must have a reply so the user can verify everything was addressed.

## Evaluating feedback — be skeptical

Skip (with a reply explaining why) issues that are:
- Pre-existing (not introduced by this PR)
- False positives / don't hold up to scrutiny
- Nitpicks a senior engineer wouldn't flag
- Things linter/typechecker catches (CI handles those)
- Style/formatting issues
- Already addressed in a previous commit

Fix issues that are:
- Real runtime bugs introduced by this PR
- Security issues
- CLAUDE.md violations
- Data loss risks

## Merging

**Never auto-merge by default.** Only merge when the user explicitly asks you to.

`/ship-now` is an explicit fast-path exception. When it is invoked, follow
`ship-now`'s local targeted-recovery gate and immediate admin-merge rule instead
of waiting for this section's remote-CI and soak requirements.

When the user does ask to merge, all of these must be true **simultaneously for 10 consecutive minutes** before merging:

1. **No local uncommitted changes** except the documented routine exclusions
2. **No unpushed commits** — the publishable-path `git log` check from Step 0
   must be empty
3. **All GitHub Actions CI green** — Build, Lint, Test, Typecheck, Scaffold E2E, Guard
4. **All review comments addressed** — every human/bot inline comment and review-body item has a fix or a reply
5. **No merge conflicts** — `gh pr view --json mergeable --jq '.mergeable'` must be `MERGEABLE`

The 10-minute soak timer **resets to zero** whenever the branch is pushed, CI
fails, a new review comment arrives, or merge conflicts appear.

Only after 10 consecutive clean minutes, force merge with `gh pr merge <number> --squash --admin`.

## Stop conditions

- No new actionable feedback AND GitHub Actions green for 30 consecutive minutes
- PR is merged or closed

Before stopping OR merging, the unaddressed-comments command above must print **nothing** — re-run it as the final gate. "I replied earlier" is not sufficient; bots may have posted new rounds since.
