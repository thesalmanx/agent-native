# Concurrent Agents

Steve runs many Claude Code and Codex sessions against this one checkout on
purpose, often on the same branch or file. Default assumption on every task:
the working tree is shared branch state. Read existing changes before editing
them, and never reset, clean, stash, or overwrite local work without explicit
authorization.

## Read before you edit

Before touching a file that already has uncommitted changes, re-read it and
build your edit on top of what's there. Landing your own complete fix over a
peer's in-progress one has happened repeatedly — "another agent landed its own
complete fix for the exact same bug in the exact same file, overwriting my
in-progress edits on disk." There is no conflict, no warning; the edit vanishes.

## Diagnosing "did someone revert my work" — correctly

`git diff --stat` line counts are not evidence of a revert — a refactor can
show the same magnitude of deletions. An agent once announced a revert from
stat counts alone and was wrong; it cost a full investigation to disprove.
Before you say "reverted" out loud, run:

```bash
git log --oneline <base>..HEAD    # what actually landed, in order
git diff <base>..HEAD -- <path>   # the real hunks for the files in question
```

Read the hunks: a revert removes logic and puts nothing equivalent back; a
refactor removes the same lines and adds different code doing the same job.
Only the hunks tell you which happened — never `--stat` alone.

## Shallow or grafted worktrees

Shallow clones and grafted worktrees do not have complete ancestry. Treat
`git log -S` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor` results at their boundary as
inconclusive; fetch complete history or verify the date through the remote
commit or pull-request record before calling a change the first occurrence.

## Never move branches without an explicit instruction

Don't create, switch, delete, reset, rebase, stash, or worktree-add a branch
unless the user asked for that exact operation in the current task — it
strands every other agent on it. This isn't a tool-level block anymore —
`.agents/skills/new-branch/SKILL.md` carries it now, through an activation
guard that refuses to fire unless the user explicitly asked for `/new-branch`
or a fresh branch. That guard is what took unrequested branch creation from a
recurring complaint to zero; read it before any branch operation instead of
assuming a prohibition still lives at the tool layer.

## Timing the next branch

Before running `/new-branch`, even on an explicit request, confirm that the
current branch has been fully checkpointed and inspect the active worktrees:

```bash
git status --short
ls .claude/worktrees/ 2>/dev/null
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --state open
```

Run `corepack pnpm ship:push` for any nonignored changes before moving to the
next branch. Do not leave local work behind during branch rotation.

## Before you ship

Before you commit, push, or merge, check `git log --oneline -5`, `git status`,
and `gh pr list --head <branch>` for the current PR. If the work you were
about to do just landed, continue from the latest branch snapshot.

## Reading a Codex peer's intent

Relaying between agents by hand is the user's most tedious job — don't make
him paste what a Codex session is doing. Read its transcript yourself:

```bash
ls ~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl
```

Each line is a JSON event; `payload.type == "user_message"` is what the user
asked, `payload.type == "agent_message"` is what it answered — enough to learn
a peer's task without interrupting it or the user.
