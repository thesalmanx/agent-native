/**
 * One-time session capture for the beta E2E suite.
 *
 * CI cannot sign in: beta hosts accept Google OAuth only, and an automated run
 * must never drive a credential form. So a human signs in once, here, in a
 * visible browser, and this prints the secret CI replays.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm e2e:beta:capture                 # every authenticatable beta app
 *   pnpm e2e:beta:capture slides,chat     # just these
 *
 * For each app it opens the real sign-in page, waits for you to complete
 * Google sign-in, then reads back the framework session cookie that host
 * issued. The result is a JSON map to paste into the BETA_E2E_SESSION_TOKENS
 * repository secret.
 *
 * These tokens are framework sessions for whichever account you sign in with.
 * They last 30 days, they are as powerful as being logged in as that account,
 * and they belong in a secret store, never in the repo. Prefer a dedicated
 * e2e account over a personal one — then `BETA_E2E_EMAIL` is that account and
 * every authenticated spec asserts it is running as exactly that identity.
