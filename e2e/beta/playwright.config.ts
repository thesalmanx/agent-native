 * Browser E2E against the deployed Agent-Native beta fleet.
 *
 * This suite does not start a server. It drives the real beta deploys listed in
 * scripts/netlify-beta-sites.json to answer one question before a promotion:
 * would a user hitting these hosts right now be able to sign in, load the app,
 * and get a working agent turn?
 *
 * Two lanes:
 *   public  no credentials, every host, zero model spend. Always runs.
 *   authenticated  needs BETA_E2E_SESSION_TOKENS (or BETA_E2E_STORAGE_STATE)
 *                  and BETA_E2E_OPENAI_API_KEY for chat. Spends
 *                  luna tokens only in those clusters.
 *
 * `ignoreHTTPSErrors` is deliberately left unset: "the connection isn't
 * private" was a real beta report, and only a browser that still checks
 * certificates can catch it.
