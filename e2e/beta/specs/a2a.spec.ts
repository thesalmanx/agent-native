/**
 * Cross-app delegation: Slides asking Analytics for data.
 *
 * Read the result carefully — the peer Slides reaches is **production**
 * Analytics, not beta Analytics. First-party peer URLs come from the template
 * registry, which stores one production URL per app and has no beta-aware
 * branch, so a beta deploy delegates across the lane boundary. That is worth
 * knowing on its own; it also means this test proves the delegation *path*
 * (discovery, signing, transport, rendering) rather than beta-to-beta
 * behaviour, and that a green result here does not clear beta Analytics.
 *
 * Slides is the right origin for this: its agent runs with local database
 * tools off, so an analytics-shaped question has no local shortcut and must be
 * delegated. That makes the assertion deterministic instead of hopeful.
